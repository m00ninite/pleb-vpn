# Pleb-VPN  
_Easy VPS sharing for cheaper hybrid solution for Plebs...built for Raspiblitz._

`Version 1.0 including LND hybrid, CLN hybrid, WireGuard, tor split-tunneling, btcpay/lnbits letsencrypt, and recurring payments with keysend messages`

**Pleb-VPN is a Raspiblitz tool set that allows you to easily take your node
from a tor-only node to a hybrid solution with a public Virtual Private Server, _either yours 
or someone elses!_ It also includes a number of tools to facilitate this, including an 
easy-to-install implementation of WireGuard for private, secure VPN access to your node 
anywhere, anytime, the ability to take BTCPayServer and/or LNBits public, and the ability to 
automatically send recurring payments over lightning via keysend and include a message in the 
payment. Pleb-VPN works with both LND and Core Lightning node implementations.**

Pleb-VPN was born out of the realization that tor was always going to be
insufficient for routing nodes, and that most Plebs either won't afford
or can't set up (or both) a VPS with a VPN and enable hybrid mode on their
node. Enter Pleb-VPN! This enables easy VPS sharing and lowers the cost of
going clearnet for Plebs.

Pleb-VPN is a free open-source Raspiblitz integration of OpenVPN and WireGuard, 
and includes scripts to configure either LND or Core Lightning (or both!) for 
hybrid mode. It also includes the abiliy to take BTCPayServer and/or LNBits public using 
LetsEncrypt for any DNS provider that allows a CNAME record. You may use this in conjunction 
with your own VPS set up as an OpenVPN server, or you may contact me on TG @allyourbankarebelongtous 
or via email: allyourbankarebelongtous@protonmail.com, agree to a $2.00 US per month fee for the 
basic service, paid via the included automatic keysends with a message stating your node's email address 
or your telegram handle, and obtain access to my VPS to go clearnet. 
The basic service includes two ports, one for hybrid mode and one for wireguard. 
Additional ports are $0.50 US per month) You would be paying for VPS access/use, not for Pleb-VPN software, 
which is free. If you don't want to pay or are uncomfortable with sharing, feel free to use this with your 
own VPS. The cheapest I've found that works costs $5.00 US per month, and you'll have to configure 
it yourself.  
_Note: If you want BTCPayServer and/or LNBits available to the public, it is a bit more expensive 
for me, so it is an additional $1.00 US per month for each port 443 forward from @allyourbankarebelongtous)._

If there are any other Plebs who want to share their VPS for a small fee, feel free
to advertize and direct interested parties here for the easy-to-implement Raspiblitz
hybrid option! This will work with any public VPN (in the sense that the IP of the VPS 
is for public access) that uses OpenVPN for its connection and allows port forwarding.

**You can also set up your VPS to share with others as a VPN if you like to help
increase the availability of clearnet/hybrid nodes on the lightning network!**

## How it Works  
Pleb-VPN uses OpenVPN to connect to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and configures
Raspiblitz to only use that connection to go to the outside world (your home LAN
remains unaffected and can access the blitz still). At this point, your public
facing IP address becomes the IP address of the VPS. The connection between the VPS
and the Raspiblitz is encrypted by the OpenVPN protocol. From there, going to a
hybrid or clearnet solution for LND or Core Lightning is more private as you 
will not release your home IP to the outside world.

Pleb-VPN provides easy Raspiblitz menu access to install and configure OpenVPN,
and then configure hybrid mode on or off for either LND or Core Lightning (or
both). Pleb-VPN configures the node such that if the VPS goes offline you will
not accidentally release your home IP (called a killswitch). Pleb-VPN also allows
as of version 0.9.1 for you to optionally split-tunnel tor off of the VPN. See FAQ 
and Split-Tunneling Tor below for more details.

Pleb-VPN also provides easy Raspiblitz menu access to install and configure WireGuard,
a private VPN service that will run through the VPS, encrypted end-to-end from the
Raspiblitz to any client connected to the blitz that you configure, giving you 
a secure, simulated LAN that allows you to securely access all features of your
Raspiblitz as if you were home from anywhere in the world. This feature is entirely
set up locally on the Raspiblitz, so **even if you are sharing a VPS with someone you 
don't know, they'll never get access to your Raspiblitz.**

Finally, Pleb-VPN comes with the ability to automatically send recurring payments 
over lightning via keysend. _(credit to m00ninite's excellent scripts, found here: 
https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/pull/2404)._

**Pleb-VPN also ensures that all configurations will remain when you reflash the SD 
card for Raspiblitz updates.**

## FAQ  
**How is this different than TunnelSats?**  
Good question. It's really not that much different. TunnelSats uses one or more
shared servers and provides you with a cert to connect to them, only it uses WireGuard
instead of OpenVPN for the connection. TunnelSats configures split-tunneling such that
the node's clearnet traffic is the ONLY thing going through the VPN, whereas Pleb-VPN 
by default sends ALL TRAFFIC through the VPN, and gives you the option to configure 
split-tunneling so that tor is the only thing ALLOWED TO BYPASS the VPN. This allows 
Pleb-VPN to run WireGuard over the VPN and allows you to run multiple nodes from one instance. 
Pleb-VPN's other advantage is the ability to take BTCPayServer and/or LNBits public, allowing you 
to grant easy, secure access to your LNBits implementation or to easily provide payment services 
through BTCPayServer to the outside world. TunnelSats cannot do this.

TunnelSats is also available for other node implementations easily, like Umbrel or MyNode. 
However, Pleb-VPN is cheaper, and encourages Plebs to collaborate to make the lightning network 
more decentralized (less reliance on one or two providers) and more robust (more 
hybrid/clearnet nodes). Plus, it comes with a private VPN already integrated in WireGuard.

**How secure is this?**  
It's as secure as any VPN. The OpenVPN encryption is AES-256-CBC, and WireGuard uses
Curve25519 point multiplication as its primary method of private key/public key
encryption. The owner of the VPS (this is true regardless of if you run it yourself,
or if you share, or if you use TunnelSats) _will_ know your home IP address. They will _NOT_ 
have access to your LAN, your WireGuard virtual LAN, or your Raspiblitz itself. A bonus of 
sharing a VPS is that there is no KYC required...the only knowledge the VPS owner will have
that the rest of the world doesn't have is your home IP address. _This is true whether you rent 
your own VPS, use TunnelSats, or use Pleb-VPN with @allyourbankarebelongtous!_

**Can I use this on an Umbrel/MyNode/Raspibolt/etc implementation?**  
Sort of. The actual software here on GitHub is only for Raspiblitz (for now), but if you
can find a guide to install OpenVPN and take your node clearnet on your own nothing
is stopping you from contacting @allyourbankarebelongtous or anyone else willing to
share a VPS and paying them a small monthly fee to gain a clearnet IP and a couple of forwarded
ports. You will have to figure out how to change the port LND or Core Lightning uses 
to talk to the outside world and how to implement hybrid mode or clearnet yourself. 
There are numerous guides on how to do this.

**I want to update my node. What do I need to do?**  
Update like normal according to Raspiblitz instructions. Pleb-VPN will automatically
reinstall and reconfigure to match what you had before, including any recurring 
payments scheduled or LetsEncrypt certs for BTCPay or LNBits.

**Can I remove Pleb-VPN?**  
Yes. The menu provides an option to completely uninstall and restore the original
node configuration at any time.

**What if Pleb-VPN scripts are updated? How do I update mine?**  
The menu has an option to update the scripts by pulling them from GitHub. It takes about 
a half a second and keeps all of your settings.

## Install Instructions:  
1. Exit to command line from the menu (you should be in directory /home/admin).  
2. From /home/admin, clone the repository by copying and pasting the following command:  
   `git clone https://github.com/allyourbankarebelongtous/pleb-vpn.git`  
3. Fix the permissions, copy, paste into the command line, and run:  
   `sudo chmod -R 755 /home/admin/pleb-vpn`  
4. Run the install script by copying and pasting:  
   `/home/admin/pleb-vpn/pleb-vpn.install.sh on`  

Access Pleb-VPN from the menu and try it out!

## Getting Started:  
After install you should have a menu that looks like this:  
![MainMenu](pictures/mainmenu.png)

Select "PLEB-VPN" to enter the Pleb-VPN Main Menu:  
![Pleb-VPNMenu](pictures/pleb-vpnmenu.png)

Here there are five options available, although you will initially only see four.  
These options are:  
STATUS - Get the current status of installed services  
SERVICES - Install and configure VPNs and hybrid mode  
PAYMENTS - Manage, add, or remove recurring payments  
WIREGUARD-CONNECT - Get WireGuard config files for clients (only shows when WireGuard installed)  
PLEB-VPN - Uninstall or update Pleb-VPN  

### Connect the VPN
Looking at the SERVICES menu, you will only see one option initially:  
![ServicesMenuInitial](pictures/servicesmenuinitial.png)

Initially the only thing you can activate is Pleb-VPN, which is the OpenVPN connection
to the VPS that gives you a public IP different than your home IP. Activating the other
services without this will only dox your home IP (WireGuard wouldn't, but unless you
have a static home IP, which is unlikely, you'd have to constantly re-configure WireGuard).

After activating Pleb-VPN, you are asked to send the OpenVPN config file (called plebvpn.conf)
to the node using scp. The node gives you the command to run. If you already have uploaded
it and are just re-enabling Pleb-VPN, it will find the old .conf file and ask if you
want to keep it or upload a new one.  
![UploadplebVPNConf](pictures/uploadplebvpnconf.png)

Once the script has run, it will check the status of the VPN connection and display the
status screen:  
![Pleb-VPNStatusScreen](pictures/plebvpnstatusscreen.png)

Once your VPN is connected it will automatically restart every time the Raspiblitz
starts up. If for some reason you want to manually disconnect without uninstalling,
you can use the command line:  
Stop (service will still start on boot): `sudo systemctl stop openvpn@plebvpn`  
Disable (service will not start on boot): `sudo systemctl disable openvpn@plebvpn`  
Enable (autostart on boot): `sudo systemctl enable openvpn@plebvpn`  
Start (start now): `sudo systemctl start openvpn@plebvpn`  

### Go Hybrid
Now that your VPN connection to the VPS is up, the SERVICES menu shows more options:  
![ServicesMenuInstalled](pictures/servicesmenuinstalled.png)

From here, it should show the option to enable hybrid mode on whichever node implementation
is active on your node. If the service detects that both are installed, it will display
both, as shown here. Lets activate hybrid mode for LND (the steps are identical for Core Lightning).

The first thing the script will do is ask for a port to use. This is because to share
a server, the nodes have to use different ports. If you got your plebvpn.conf from
another pleb, you should also get a port to use for your node. This is where you enter
the port:  
![LNDHybridport](pictures/lndhybridport.png)

If you've already entered a port, the script will use the port already entered (i.e., for
re-enabling hybrid after turning it off). The process is the same for Core Lightning.  
_If you use both node implementations side by side, they MUST use different ports!_

After it finishes the configuration and the wallet is unlocked, the script displays the 
status which should now show your new clearnet address and port. If you have channels 
connected, this data should reflect on lightning explorers such as amboss.space within 
an hour (takes time for the gossip data to propagate).  
![LNDHybridStatus](pictures/lndhybridstatus.png)

BOOM! You now have a hybrid node with a VPS!

### LetsEncrypt for BTCPay and LNBits
The LetsEncrypt service will show under the SERVICES Pleb-VPN menu only if it detects that either 
BTCPayServer or LNBits is installed. Here's what it looks like:
![letsencryptservice](pictures/letsencryptservice.png)

If you have a VPS that is capable of forwarding port 443 to your raspiblitz, you can point a 
domain to your VPS IP and forward it to BTCPay or LNBits, allowing you to accept payments from 
customers on BTCPay and/or allow others to access your LNBits instance. It takes a bit more 
work to enable both on your own VPS, but it's doable. If you subscribe to @allyourbankarebelongtous, 
for a small extra fee per service I will forward you port 443 to either or both of your services.

Once you have a domain that can reach your LNBits or BTCPayServer from the public internet over 
port 443 through your VPS, it's time to get some SSL certs! This is where this service comes in 
handy. This script configures LetsEncrypt on your Raspiblitz for either BTCPay, LNBits, or both using 
CNAME authentication over your domain, so it works with any domain you have that allows you to enter 
a CNAME record. If you're not sure you can enter a CNAME record, contact your DNS provider to ask. 

Step 1 is to get your domain pointed to your VPS. 
Step 2 is to forward the port (or contact your VPS provider to get them to forward the port) 
Step 3 is to ensure that you know how to update the CNAME record of you domain

Once all of these are accomplished, go ahead and run this script. When you first run the script, 
it will display these instructions. Here's what it looks like:
![letsencryptinstructions](pictures/letsencryptinstructions.png)

You can tell you are ready to run the script if each domain you have (one for BTCPay and/or one 
for LNBits) can access your instance and the only issue you have is it's warning you that your 
connection is not trusted. You must also be ready to update the CNAME record of each domain.

After you acknowledge the instructions, the script will install Certbot, which will guide you 
through the install. Then the script has to gather some more information.

Next you will be asked which service you want to install. The script will only display services you 
have already installed on your node. If you intend to install LetsEncrypt for both BTCPayServer 
and LNBits, it is recommended that you do so at the same time, as you will only get one cert, so 
if you add another service at a different time you will have to update both CNAME records. Here's 
what it looks like if you have both BTCPayServer and LNBits installed on your node: 
![letsencryptselectservices](pictures/letsencryptselectservices.png)

Once you have selected the service(s) that will be encrypted, the script asks for one (or both) 
domain names. In this case, I have selected both. Here's domain entry No. 1:
![letsencryptdomain1](pictures/letsencryptdomain1.png)

If you selected both services, you'll need two separate domain names. The script will ask for a second 
domain name if you selected both BTCPayServer and LNBits. Here's domain entry No. 2:
![letsencryptdomain2](pictures/letsencryptdomain2.png)

After this, the script displays instructions on entering the CNAME record. It looks like this: 
![letsencryptinstructions](pictures/letsencryptinstructions.png)

Then Certbot starts to run and will ask you if you agree to the terms:
![Certbot_terms](pictures/Certbot_terms.png)

Once you agree, it will finish and display this screen:
![CNAME_Challenges](pictures/CNAME_Challenges.png)

**IMPORTANT! You must update your CNAME records before pressing enter!**  
Here I have to enter my CNAME records for both btcpay.allyourbank.ink and lnbits.allyourbank.ink 
to demonstrate that I own those domains. Here's what my DNS service looks like after the update 
(this is using name.com, which has good prices and a good reputation):
![CNAME_Entry](pictures/CNAME_Entry.png)

After you update your CNAME record(s), wait a bit for the update to propagate (a minute is more 
than enough usually), and then hit enter. The script should finish installing the certs and you should 
be good to go!

Here's my BTCPayServer and LNBits from the example above showing a secure connection:
![btcpayssl](pictures/btcpayssl.png)
![lnbitsssl](pictures/lnbitsssl.png)

_Note: If you have already installed LetsEncrypt previously and are re-enabling it after turning it off, 
the script will detect a previous configuration and ask you if you want to keep it. Only select "Use Existing"  
if you haven't changed anything about the domains, including the CNAME record you established when first 
enabling LetsEncrypt._

Certbot will auto-update the certs when necessary, and Pleb-VPN should preserve the certs through 
Raspiblitz updates or sd card reflashes.

### Installing WireGuard
Let's install WireGuard next. Using the services menu, toggle WireGuard on.
The first thing the script will ask is for you to chose an ip address for the node. This
is a private IP address, and can be anything in the range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.252
(the reason for it only going to 252 is that there are three client IPs which need to
be added).  
![WireGuardIP](pictures/wireguardip.png)

Next the script will ask you for a port, just like the hybrid mode script. 
Your VPS provider (or yourself, if you run your own server) can give you this port 
as well. Enter it here. _Do not use the same port as your node!_  

After that's done, the script will instruct you to download the WireGuard client app
from the google or apple app store. With that app, scan the QR code that will display
on the screen. This will give your phone the private key it needs to securely connect
with your node (these keys are generated locally and never leave your node until you 
download them via the WIREGUARD-CONNECT menu option). Once install is finished, the 
script will present you with the status of your connection, which will look like this:
![WireGuardStatus](pictures/wireguardstatus.png)
In this example I chose 10.0.0.0, so that's the IP I will use to connect to my apps on
the Raspiblitz.

You can also obtain the WireGuard client conf files from the WIREGUARD-CONNECT menu
within the main Pleb-VPN menu. You will get three files, one (mobile.conf) is also
displayed as a QR code, but the other two (laptop.conf and desktop.conf) are only
available via scp download through the WIREGUARD-CONNECT menu. To configure more than
three clients will require you to manually edit the WireGuard configuration. There
are several tutorials out there on how to do this.

Once you have WireGuard configured, you can turn it on on your phone and/or laptop/desktop, 
and connect to any service on your node securely by using the WireGuard IP you selected. For 
example, to connect to ThunderHub, have the WireGuard client activated on your phone and 
enter ip.ip.ip.ip:3010 on your phone's browser, where ip.ip.ip.ip is the WireGuard IP that
you selected. To access the blitz api, enter ip.ip.ip.ip. To configure Zeus to connect over 
WireGuard, uncheck tor and enter your WireGuard ip in place of the tor address.  

_Note: Because the connection is secured by WireGuard there is no need to enable ssl encryption, 
but you can anyways if you download the cert and install it on your phone. You will need to 
re-create the cert first to ensure it includes your WireGuard IP. This can be done by either 
using the Raspiblitz Menu, going to CONNECT and then RESET, which will also reset your 
macaroons (you will have to reconnect any mobile wallets or other apps which use macaroons), 
or by deleting /mnt/hdd/lnd/tls.cert and /mnt/hdd/lnd/tls.key, restarting lnd, and 
restarting nginx._   

Here's a screenshot of me accessing the blitz api via WireGuard on my
phone using the 10.0.0.0 IP shown above:  
![BlitzAPIWireGuardAccess](pictures/blitzapiwireguardaccess.png)

### Split-Tunneling Tor
Split-tunneling is a feature that configures traffic from tor to bypass the VPN while still
forcing everything else through the VPN. The killswitch remains enforced on your firewall,
so if the VPN drops, no clearnet traffic will go out of your node to avoid accidentally doxing 
your home IP (it will still allow SSH from the local LAN). However, enabling this will still allow 
tor, so you will gain redundancy. 

The other advantages to split-tunneling tor away from the VPN are that if there are multiple 
tor users coming from the same server then tor will probably be slower from that server, so it 
reduces congestion at the VPS. 

To enable split-tunneling for tor, just activate it from the SERVICES menu. This will configure 
tor traffic to skip the VPN by creating a special group called novpn, marking traffic generated by 
that group, creating separate routing rules for marked traffic, and finally by adding tor to that 
group. 

After the script runs, it will run through a series of tests to determine if it was successful. These 
tests take some time (up to 12 minutes) depending on how long it takes tor to re-establish a circuit 
using the new routing. After this is complete, you should get a status screen that looks like this:
![SplitTunnelTorStatus](pictures/splittunneltorstatus.png)

The way it checks the split-tunneling is as follows:  
- check current IP (should be VPN IP) by running `curl https://api.ipify.org`  
- disable the VPN `sudo systemctl stop openvpn@plebvpn`  
- check if clearnet is accessible (shouldn't be) `curl https://api.ipify.org`  
- check if tor is accessible (should be) `torify curl http://api.ipify.org`  
- restart Pleb-VPN `sudo systemctl start openvpn@plebvpn`  
- check clearnet IP (should be VPN IP) `curl https://api.ipify.org`  
_Note: if you run a status check of tor-split-tunneling immediately after boot or after restarting
tor it will likely fail to connect over tor. It takes about a minute for the controller to identify 
that tor is running and add it to the novpn cgroup, and then tor has to re-establish a circuit. If this 
check fails, as long as it doesn't fail such that clearnet is accessible with the VPN off, wait a 
few minutes and try again._

### Recurring Payments
Lastly, let's check out payments. Payments were included in this to encourage VPS 
operators to open their servers to other clients, and to make paying for VPS 
services easier for Plebs. Here is the PAYMENTS menu:  
![PaymentMenu](pictures/paymentmenu.png)


Here you can schedule recurring keysends using either LND or Core Lightning as your 
node. The service lets you decide which node implementation to use if you have both installed. 
It also lets you schedule the payment in sats or USD, and does the USD-sat conversion in 
real-time each time it sends. The PAYMENTS menu has four sections:  
NEW - lets you create a new recurring payment  
VIEW - displays all current active payments and their schedule  
DELETE - allows you to select a payment from among all of them and delete it  
DELTE-ALL - deletes all payments  

The process of scheduling a new payment is self-explanatory, but for fun here's what 
it looks like on a Raspiblitz that has both LND and Core Lightning running on it.

After selecting NEW, the script asks what denomination to use:  
![ChooseDenomination](pictures/choosedenomination.png)

Then the script asks how much you want each payment to be. Here's a USD example:  
![EnterAmount](pictures/enteramount.png)

Then which node you want to use (only asks if you have both LND and Core Lightning installed and enabled):  
![WhichNodeToUse](pictures/whichnodetouse.png)

Then asks for the pubkey of the receiver:  
![ReceiverPubkey](pictures/receiverpubkey.png)

Then how often to send:  
![HowOften](pictures/howoften.png)

Then you are asked if you want to include a message. Keysends are anonymous, in that the receiver 
has no way of knowing who the sender is. You can include a message (required for @allyourbankarebelongtous 
subscriptions) that tells the sender who is sending and why. This will work with both LND and Core Lightning 
node implementations. If you wish to include a message, select "yes": 
![keysendmessage](pictures/keysendmessage.png)

Here, enter your message:
![enterkeysendmessage](pictures/enterkeysendmessage.png)

That's it. The payment is scheduled! The script will NOT send the payment right away,
it will wait until 00:00:00 UTC, and only send on the following schedule:  
DAILY - Every day at 00:00:00 UTC  
WEEKLY - Every Sunday at 00:00:00 UTC  
MONTHLY - Every 1st day of the month at 00:00:00 UTC  
YEARLY - Every 1st day of the year at 00:00:00 UTC  

Use VIEW to view your currently scheduled payments. Here's an example of me paying myself
a bunch of times for testing purposes from both LND and Core Lightning with test messages:  
![ViewPayments](pictures/veiwpayments.png)

Use DELETE to get rid of a payment. Here's what that looks like:  
![DeletePayment](pictures/deletepayment.png)

Use DELETE-ALL to delete all payments.  

Payments that are scheduled will remain through Raspiblitz updates. The payments are
enabled using systemd timers that activate the service that sends the payments. If your
node is down during a payment send time, the node will attempt to send the payment up to
10 times, and if it doesn't get a successful return after that, that payment _will NOT
send again_ until you manually re-enable the payment. To re-enable payments you can
reboot the Raspiblitz (easiest), or manually start them using systemd commands to 
restart the timer, like so:  
`sudo systemctl restart payments-daily-lnd.timer`  
`daily` can be substituded for any timeframe from `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `yearly`,
and `lnd` can be `lnd` or `cln` depending on your node implementation. 
This will restart a failed daily payment from an LND node, but will _not_ resend the failed payment.
You can change daily or lnd to your specific timing and node implementation.

To manually send an individual missed payment you can run the keysend 
script that is saved in /home/admin/pleb-vpn/payments/keysends, for example:  
`sudo -u bitcoin /home/admin/pleb-vpn/payments/keysends/_035fed4_monthly_cln_keysend.sh`  
sends the monthly payment of 100 sats from my Core Lightning node each time I run that command. 
(Command needs to be run as user bitcoin or it will fail for Core Lightning nodes). 

For payments that were scheduled at a certain time you can manually run that service with the following:  
`sudo systemctl start payments-<frequency>-<lnd or cln>.service`  where `<frequency>` is either
`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `yearly`, and  `<lnd or cln>` is either `lnd` if you're using
LND or `cln` if you're using Core Lightning. This will send all `<frequency>` payments from 
any `<lnd or cln>` node.

For example, to manually at any time send the payments that were scheduled on the 1st of the
month to come from my Core Lightning node I would run on the command line:  
`sudo systemctl start payments-monthly-cln.service`

### Updates or Uninstalling
The last menu, PLEB-VPN, is for updates or uninstalls. Update just pulls the latest changes
to the scripts from github (for bug fixes or new features). Uninstall will uninstall EVERYTHING
you have and restore your node to its original configuration. It will NOT delete your
plebvpn.conf file and your WireGuard config files, they will be left on the hard drive.
To remove them, you can delete /mnt/hdd/app-data/pleb-vpn and all of its contents.
